### gists being created from Notepad.js file but content is not appearing in the gists.

### when i click 'add file', it doesn't create a new gist on github, only updates the same gist, and the content of the note is not appearing in the gist file.

### TO DO:

### - make save and delete buttons functional 

### - finish NotesList page which should contain individual notes within notepad

### - save each notepad and note to local Storage
### = retrieve notepads and notes from local storage and have them appear under the current input form

### = right now same gist is being updated when a new form is saved. need to create a new gist for each new notepad, which should update with each new note within the notepad. 

### (access token should be placed in the header of all the requests that are sent to the gists API like so:
### {
### Authorization: token [[ ENTER YOUR TOKEN HERE ]] )
### }

### using 'gist-charts', make gist data chart for notepad and one for notes in notepad, to be accessed with 'stats' button
